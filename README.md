8.29 (IDENTICAL ARRAYS) The two-dimensional arrays m1 and m2 are identical if they have the same contents. Write a method that returns true if m1 and m2 are identical, using the following header:

public static boolean equals(int[][] m1, int[][] m2)

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two 3Ã—3 arrays of integers and displays whether the two are identical. 
Here are the sample runs:




Enter list 1: 51 25 22 6 1 4 24 54 6 
Enter list 2: 51 22 25 6 1 4 24 54 6 

The two arrays are identical



Enter list 1: 51 5 22 6 1 4 24 54 6 
Enter list 2: 51 22 25 6 1 4 24 54 6 

The two arrays are not identical
